# Background

This is the "Rust Language Cheat Sheet". It is for users who
* are **early Rust professionals** (experienced programmers, intermediate Rust users), and
* prefer **visual, example-driven content**

Use cases, in order of priority:
* "**identification guide**" for unknown or symbolic constructs encountered in code.
* provide **further reading** from easy to advanced (Book to Nomicon).
* quick lookup for **language related** problems.
* **discover constructs** in the language you might not know.

Design guides:
* have **high information density**; every word counts.
* be **printer and mobile friendly**
* don't repeat what's better explained elsewhere, but do state the very essence.
* have **memorable URL** :)


# Building

Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), the static site generator written in Rust. To develop locally install Zola, then run:

```
zola serve
```
