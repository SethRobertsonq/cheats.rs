# ![Logo](/static/logo.png) Rust Language Cheat Sheet

 [**READ ONLINE**](https://cheats.rs)


# Background

This is the "Rust Language Cheat Sheet". It is for users who
* are **Early Rust professionals** (experienced programmers, intermediate Rust users), and
* prefer **visual, example-driven content**

Use cases, in order of priority:
* "**Identification guide**" for unknown constructs encountered in code.
* Provide **further reading** from easy to advanced (Book to Nomicon).
* Quick lookup for **language related** problems.
* **Discover constructs** in the language you might not know.

Design guides:
* Have **high information density**; every word counts.
* Be **printer friendly**
* Don't repeat what's better explained elsewhere, but do state the very essence.
